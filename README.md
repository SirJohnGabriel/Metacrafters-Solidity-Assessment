# Metacrafters-Solidity-Assessment

This is part of the requirements for the final project in **Metacrafters ETH Proof Solidity Beginner Course**.

## Description

This project is a simulation of how creating and handling a token in a blockchain. It provides function such as minting and burning, and also checks the balance of an address and the total supply of the token.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

Once the program is deployed:
You can:
1. Check the Token Name with the **TOKEN_NAME** variable
2. Check the Token Abbreviation with the **TOKEN_ABBREVIATION** variable
3. Mint the token by specifying an **address** and **value**(non-negative).
4. Burn the token by specifying an **address** and **value**(non-negative and greater than balance, otherwise it will not proceed).
5. Lastly, check the total supply of tokens using the **tokenTotalSupply** variable.
